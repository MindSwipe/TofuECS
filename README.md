An entity component system framework for Unity. 

ECS frameworks are fun to code in and offer performance benefits against to the typical GameObject/MonoBehaviour Unity workflow, all while presenting a clear separation of logic from views. I have a lot of experience working with other frameworks, and I wanted to write my own while attempting to match their performance and ease of use.

In development. Vegan friendly.
